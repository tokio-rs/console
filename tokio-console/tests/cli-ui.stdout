The Tokio console: a debugger for async Rust.

Usage: tokio-console[EXE] [OPTIONS] [TARGET_ADDR] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  gen-config      Generate a `console.toml` config file with the default
                  configuration values, overridden by any provided
                  command-line arguments
  gen-completion  Generate shell completions
  help            Print this message or the help of the given
                  subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [TARGET_ADDR]
          The address of a console-enabled process to connect to.
          
          This may be an IP address and port, or a DNS name.
          
          On Unix platforms, this may also be a URI with the `file`
          scheme that specifies the path to a Unix domain socket, as in
          `file://localhost/path/to/socket`.
          
          When the `vsock` feature is enabled, this may also be a URI
          with the `vsock` scheme that specifies a vsock connection, as
          in `vsock://2:6669` to connect to CID 2 port 6669.
          
          [default: http://127.0.0.1:6669]

Options:
      --log <LOG_FILTER>
          Log level filter for the console's internal diagnostics.
          
          Logs are written to a new file at the path given by the
          `--log-dir` argument (or its default value), or to the system
          journal if `systemd-journald` support is enabled.
          
          If this is set to 'off' or is not set, no logs will be
          written.
          
          [default: off]
          
          [env: RUST_LOG=]

  -W, --warn <WARNINGS>...
          Enable lint warnings.
          
          This is a comma-separated list of warnings to enable.
          
          Each warning is specified by its name, which is one of:
          
          * `self-wakes` -- Warns when a task wakes itself more than a
          certain percentage of its total wakeups. Default percentage is
          50%.
          
          * `lost-waker` -- Warns when a task is dropped without being
          woken.
          
          * `never-yielded` -- Warns when a task has never yielded.
          
          * `auto-boxed-future` -- Warnings when the future driving a
          task was automatically boxed by the runtime because it was
          large.
          
          * `large-future` -- Warnings when the future driving a task
          occupies a large amount of stack space.
          
          [default: self-wakes lost-waker never-yielded
          auto-boxed-future large-future]
          [possible values: self-wakes, lost-waker, never-yielded,
          auto-boxed-future, large-future]

  -A, --allow <ALLOW_WARNINGS>...
          Allow lint warnings.
          
          This is a comma-separated list of warnings to allow.
          
          Each warning is specified by its name, which is one of:
          
          * `self-wakes` -- Warns when a task wakes itself more than a
          certain percentage of its total wakeups. Default percentage is
          50%.
          
          * `lost-waker` -- Warns when a task is dropped without being
          woken.
          
          * `never-yielded` -- Warns when a task has never yielded.
          
          * `auto-boxed-future` -- Warnings when the future driving a
          task was automatically boxed by the runtime because it was
          large.
          
          * `large-future` -- Warnings when the future driving a task
          occupies a large amount of stack space.
          
          If this is set to `all`, all warnings are allowed.
          
          [possible values: all, self-wakes, lost-waker, never-yielded,
          large-future, auto-boxed-future]

      --log-dir <LOG_DIRECTORY>
          Path to a directory to write the console's internal logs to.
          
          [default: /tmp/tokio-console/logs]

      --lang <LANG>
          Overrides the terminal's default language
          
          [env: LANG=en_US.UTF-8]

      --ascii-only <ASCII_ONLY>
          Explicitly use only ASCII characters
          
          [possible values: true, false]

      --no-colors
          Disable ANSI colors entirely

      --colorterm <truecolor>
          Overrides the value of the `COLORTERM` environment variable.
          
          If this is set to `24bit` or `truecolor`, 24-bit RGB color
          support will be enabled.
          
          [env: COLORTERM=truecolor]
          [possible values: 24bit, truecolor]

      --palette <PALETTE>
          Explicitly set which color palette to use
          
          [possible values: 8, 16, 256, all, off]

      --no-duration-colors <COLOR_DURATIONS>
          Disable color-coding for duration units
          
          [possible values: true, false]

      --no-terminated-colors <COLOR_TERMINATED>
          Disable color-coding for terminated tasks
          
          [possible values: true, false]

      --retain-for <RETAIN_FOR>
          How long to continue displaying completed tasks and dropped
          resources after they have been closed.
          
          This accepts either a duration, parsed as a combination of
          time spans (such as `5days 2min 2s`), or `none` to disable
          removing completed tasks and dropped resources.
          
          Each time span is an integer number followed by a suffix.
          Supported suffixes are:
          
          * `nsec`, `ns` -- nanoseconds
          
          * `usec`, `us` -- microseconds
          
          * `msec`, `ms` -- milliseconds
          
          * `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`
          
          * `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`

          * `months`, `month`, `M` -- defined as 30.44 days
          
          * `years`, `year`, `y` -- defined as 365.25 days
          
          [default: 6s]
