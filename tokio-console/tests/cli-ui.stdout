The Tokio console: a debugger for async Rust.

Usage: tokio-console[EXE] [OPTIONS] [TARGET_ADDR] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  gen-config
          Generate a `console.toml` config file with the default
          configuration values, overridden by any provided command-line
          arguments
  gen-completion
          Generate shell completions
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [TARGET_ADDR]
          The address of a console-enabled process to connect to.
          
          This may be an IP address and port, or a DNS name.
          
          On Unix platforms, this may also be a URI with the `file`
          scheme that specifies the path to a Unix domain socket, as in
          `file://localhost/path/to/socket`.
          
          [default: http://127.0.0.1:6669]

Options:
      --log <LOG_FILTER>
          Log level filter for the console's internal diagnostics.
          
          Logs are written to a new file at the path given by the
          `--log-dir` argument (or its default value), or to the system
          journal if `systemd-journald` support is enabled.
          
          If this is set to 'off' or is not set, no logs will be
          written.
          
          [default: off]
          
          [env: RUST_LOG=]

  -W, --warn <WARNINGS>...
          Enable lint warnings.
          
          This is a comma-separated list of warnings to enable.
          
          Each warning is specified by its name, which is one of:
          
          * `self-wakes` -- Warns when a task wakes itself more than a
          certain percentage of its total wakeups. Default percentage is
          50%.
          
          * `lost-waker` -- Warns when a task is dropped without being
          woken.
          
          * `never-yielded` -- Warns when a task has never yielded.
          
          [default: self-wakes lost-waker never-yielded]
          [possible values: self-wakes, lost-waker, never-yielded]

  -A, --allow <ALLOW_WARNINGS>...
          Allow lint warnings.
          
          This is a comma-separated list of warnings to allow.
          
          Each warning is specified by its name, which is one of:
          
          * `self-wakes` -- Warns when a task wakes itself more than a
          certain percentage of its total wakeups. Default percentage is
          50%.
          
          * `lost-waker` -- Warns when a task is dropped without being
          woken.
          
          * `never-yielded` -- Warns when a task has never yielded.
          
          If this is set to `all`, all warnings are allowed.
          
          [possible values: all, self-wakes, lost-waker, never-yielded]

      --log-dir <LOG_DIRECTORY>
          Path to a directory to write the console's internal logs to.
          
          [default: /tmp/tokio-console/logs]

      --lang <LANG>
          Overrides the terminal's default language
          
          [env: LANG=en_US.UTF-8]

      --ascii-only <ASCII_ONLY>

      --colorterm <truecolor>
          Overrides the value of the `COLORTERM` environment variable.
          
          If this is set to `24bit` or `truecolor`, 24-bit RGB color
          support will be enabled.
          
          [env: COLORTERM=truecolor]
          [possible values: 24bit, truecolor]

      --palette <PALETTE>
          Explicitly set which color palette to use
          
          [possible values: 8, 16, 256, all, off]

      --retain-for <RETAIN_FOR>
          How long to continue displaying completed tasks and dropped
          resources after they have been closed.
          
          This accepts either a duration, parsed as a combination of
          time spans (such as `5days 2min 2s`), or `none` to disable
          removing completed tasks and dropped resources.
          
          Each time span is an integer number followed by a suffix.
          Supported suffixes are:
          
          * `nsec`, `ns` -- nanoseconds
          
          * `usec`, `us` -- microseconds
          
          * `msec`, `ms` -- milliseconds
          
          * `seconds`, `second`, `sec`, `s`
          
          * `minutes`, `minute`, `min`, `m`
          
          * `hours`, `hour`, `hr`, `h`

          * `years`, `year`, `y` -- defined as 365.25 days
          
          [default: 6s]
